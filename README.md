## About
Classifying images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) using a convolutional neural network.  The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  The project will require building a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, we will see our neural network's predictions on the sample images.
